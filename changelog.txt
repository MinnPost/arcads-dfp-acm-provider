Changelog
=========

* 0.0.2 (2020-04-06)

    * Previously the prevent ads field only stopped ads from being added to the content. If a post had existing ad shortcodes, they stayed in the content without being rendered as ads. This removes them from the content instead.

* 0.0.1 (2019-06-19)

	* Basic plugin that generates code for the ArcAd wrapper on DFP ads within the ACM plugin.
